Steps For the Project
----------------------
1. Create an IAM User and Create Access Token

  -> create provider.tf file
  -> git clone 
  -> terraform init,plan,apply

1. Run the Terraform Script
  
  -> Creates VPC with 2 Private and 2 Public Subnet in us-east-1a and ua-east-1b
  -> Internet-Gateway and NAT-Gateway is routed
  -> Creates a S3 Bucket with name projbucket-494273343511
  -> Creates a RDS in private subnet
  -> Creates a Dynamo-DB Table with name employee_image_table and Partition key as empid(N)
  -> Key-Pair for EC2 Instance 
  -> Launches 2 ubuntu instances in both private subnet
  -> IAM role for EC2 to access S3 and DynamoDB full access
  -> Maps these instances to a Target-Group
  -> Load-Balancer is deployed in public-subnet and mapped to the target-group
  -> Bastion-Host is created in 1 public subnet
  -> SNS is created
  -> IAM role for lambda with s3 and sns full access
  -> Lambda function is created with a python script and IAM role is created and added


2. Connect to EC2 Instance in private subnet through bastion-host and key is on local-folder where terraform ran

  -> wget https://github.com/Nikhil-tr/AWSProject1/raw/main/cmds.sh
  -> bash cmds.sh
  -> This installs all the required packages on ubuntu and the code is copied
  -> add the required credentials on config.py
  -> create a database and a table inside RDS
  -> sudo python3 EmpApp.py 


3. Lambda Function
  
  -> Add trigger as S3 bucket to the Lambda Function
  -> paste SNS arn to the python-code at target arn and deploy
  -> add subscriptions to sns


4. Deletion
  
  -> empty the bucket
  -> delete subscriptions on sns
  -> delete the trigger s3 on lambda function
  -> terraform destroy
